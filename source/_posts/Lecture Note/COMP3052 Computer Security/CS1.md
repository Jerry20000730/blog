# Preface
This course includes computer network + computer security + web development + linux + windows + software vulnerability + database + cryptography + metamorphic security. So if you don't understand something, it is pretty normal.

My suggestions for this course would be:

- Memorise and understand the abbreviations
- Look up more materials online to help you understand
- Learn to summarise
