<!-- English version -->

Welcome to the index page of Tragic Master's Wiki Site. Most of the wiki are pre-recorded in a different software (Yuque or Notion). Some of them are incomplete, while complete ones are uploaded to this website for knowledge sharing.

The initial aspiration of establishing this website is actually very amusing. This website has been re-established after the last server went down all of a sudden (I don't know why). However, because of the fact that the configuration of the last website is not recorded, all of the information was gone and I have to restart a new website all from scratch. It is at that moment that I realize how important it is to record the process of software configuration/development/maintanance. The wiki will intend to reduce second effort, improve efficiency and make the knowledge accessible to me anytime.

If interested in collaboration, please send email to <tragicmaster@outlook.com>. Thank you.

你好呀朋友，欢迎来到属于我的一个小世界。这里会有一切我之前整理的wiki文档，大多数其实都是之前在语雀软件上整理好了之后转移到这里来的，与大家共享的文档。文档建立的初衷在于提高效率，能够避免出现二次配置，文档还能够有效建立知识体系，能够保证自己在学习过程中有想要查找的知识点可以立马查到。

当然，我有的时候也不一定是完全正确的。此网站仅用于参考。

谢谢各位，如果需要联系我，请邮件发送至<tragicmaster@outlook.com> -->
